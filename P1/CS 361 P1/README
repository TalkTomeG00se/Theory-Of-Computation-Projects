# Project 1: Deterministic Finite Automata

* Author: Colten Davis
* Class: CS361 Section 3
* Semester: Spring 2021

## Overview

This program models a DFA from a given txt file that will it will be run against.
This program outputs the 5-tuples for a DFA.

## Compiling and Using

This program accepts a .txt file as an input.

To compile: javac fa/dfa/DFADriver.java
To run: java fa.dfa.DFADriver <replace with .txt file>

The output should look like below:

Q = { x x } 
Sigma = { x x }
delta = <values will be tabbed and new line separated>
q0 = x
F = { x }

<no or yes values>

## Discussion

This project was difficult. Many hours of Googling finally got me on the write track. 
The hardest part for me was using the LinkedHashMap/Sets. I have never used those
before, and I would have much rather done this whole project using string arrays as
I'm much more familiar with those. The DFAState class was easy enough to make, I only
needed a few methods. The DFA class took me almost two weeks to put together. There were
many examples online I had to follow to get the LinkedHashSet to work. Even then, I was 
getting null values for all my tuples excep the delta table. I had no clue the problem, but
luckily Visual Studio found the error and I simlply applied the fix it suggested, which in 
this case was to cast an iterator as a DFAState. I only ran this against the three 
provided test cases, so hopefully it passes the rest. I am also wondering if this 
code will be a mess to build onto later.

## Testing

I ran my program against the 3 .txt files provided and the program
passed all the tests.
